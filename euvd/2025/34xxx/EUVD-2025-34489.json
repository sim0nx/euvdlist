  "description": "Adobe Connect versions 12.9 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by a high-privileged attacker to execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must navigate to a crafted web page. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high. Scope is changed.",
