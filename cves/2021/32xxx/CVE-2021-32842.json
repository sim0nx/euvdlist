  "description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Starting version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file is under a destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `_baseDirectory` ends with slash. If the _baseDirectory is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. Version 1.3.3 fixed this vulnerability.",
