  "description": "An Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability, a stored XSS (or persistent), in the Control Center Controller web pages of Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance (Formerly Netrounds) allows a high-privilege attacker with 'WRITE' permissions to store one or more malicious scripts that will infect any other authorized user's account when they accidentally trigger the malicious script(s) while managing the device. Triggering these attacks enables the attacker to execute commands with the permissions up to that of the superuser account. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance (Formerly Netrounds) All versions prior to 3.1.1; 3.2 versions prior to 3.2.1.",
