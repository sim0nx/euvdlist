  "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 25.2.169 and Application prior to 25.2.1518 (VA and SaaS deployments) expose Docker internal networks in a way that allows an attacker on the same external L2 segment \u2014 or an attacker able to add routes using the appliance as a gateway \u2014 to reach container IPs directly. This grants access to internal services (HTTP APIs, Redis, MySQL, etc.) that are intended to be isolated inside the container network. Many of those services are accessible without authentication or are vulnerable to known exploitation chains. As a result, compromise of a single reachable endpoint or basic network access can enable lateral movement, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and full system compromise.",
