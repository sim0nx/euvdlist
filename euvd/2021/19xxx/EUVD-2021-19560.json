  "description": "Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions an attacker is able to bypass Two Factor Authentication in Nextcloud. Thus knowledge of a password, or access to a WebAuthN trusted device of a user was sufficient to gain access to an account. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. There are no workaround for this vulnerability.",
