  "description": "Git for Windows is a fork of Git that contains Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into `C:\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exe` by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the `C:\\mingw64` folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in `C:\\`.",
