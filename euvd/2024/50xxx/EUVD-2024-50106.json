  "description": "The ImagePress \u2013 Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'imagepress_admin_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings, including redirection URLs, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
