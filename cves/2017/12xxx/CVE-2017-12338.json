  "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted command on the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker unauthorized access to read arbitrary files on the underlying local file system. On products that support multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read files from any VDC. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, Unified Computing System Manager.
