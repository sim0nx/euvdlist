  "description": "A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol handler of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.",
