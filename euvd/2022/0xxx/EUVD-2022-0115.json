  "description": "`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.",
