  "description": "In versions prior to Aidex 1.7, an authenticated malicious user, taking advantage of an open registry, could execute unauthorised commands within the system. This includes executing operating system (Unix) commands, interacting with internal services such as PHP or MySQL, and even invoking native functions of the framework used, such as Laravel or Symfony. This execution is achieved by Prompt Injection attacks through the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, manipulating the content of the ‘content’ parameter.",
