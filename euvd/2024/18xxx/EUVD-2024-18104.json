  "description": "A vulnerability in the ConfD CLI and the Cisco  Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as root on the underlying operating system.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authorization enforcement when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing an affected CLI command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the root user.",
