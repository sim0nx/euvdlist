  "description": "Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser. This issue occurs when data from a malicious source is processed by a web application's client-side scripts to update the DOM. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, such as convincing a victim to click on a malicious link.",
