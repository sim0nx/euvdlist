By persuading a victim to open a crafted URL, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to display remote OpenAPI definitions. Note: This was originally claimed to be resolved in 4.1.3. However, third parties have indicated this is not resolved in 4.1.3 and even occurs in that version and possibly others.",
