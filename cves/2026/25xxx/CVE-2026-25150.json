  "description": "Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, a prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the formToObj() function within @builder.io/qwik-city middleware. The function processes form field names with dot notation (e.g., user.name) to create nested objects, but fails to sanitize dangerous property names like __proto__, constructor, and prototype. This allows unauthenticated attackers to pollute Object.prototype by sending crafted HTTP POST requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation, authentication bypass, or denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.0.",
