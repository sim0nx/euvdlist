  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.",
