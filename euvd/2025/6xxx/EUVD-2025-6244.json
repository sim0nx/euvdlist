  "description": "The Related Posts, Inline Related Posts, Contextual Related Posts, Related Content By PickPlugins plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including 2.0.59. This is due to missing nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
