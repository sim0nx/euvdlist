  "description": "Mattermost fails to validate team membership when a user attempts to access a playbook, allowing a user with permissions to a playbook but no permissions to the team the playbook is on to access and modify the playbook. This can happen if the user was once a member of the team, got permissions to the playbook and was then removed from the team.\u00a0\n\n",
