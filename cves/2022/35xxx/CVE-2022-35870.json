  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition 8.1.15 (b2022030114). Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within com.inductiveautomation.metro.impl. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-17265.",
