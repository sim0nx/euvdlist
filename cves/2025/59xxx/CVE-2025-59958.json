  "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause impact to confidentiality and availability.\n\nWhen an output firewall filter is configured with one or more\u00a0terms where the action is 'reject', packets matching these terms are\u00a0erroneously sent to the Routing Engine (RE) and further processed there.\u00a0Processing of these packets will consume limited RE resources. Also responses from the RE back to the source of this traffic could reveal confidential information about the affected device.\nThis issue only applies to firewall filters applied to WAN or revenue interfaces, so not the mgmt or lo0 interface of the routing-engine, nor any input filters.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-EVO.",
