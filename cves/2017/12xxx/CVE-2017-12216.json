  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to have read and write access to information stored in the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the application.
