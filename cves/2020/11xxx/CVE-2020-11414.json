  "description": "An issue was discovered in Progress Telerik UI for Silverlight before 2020.1.330. The RadUploadHandler class in RadUpload for Silverlight expects a web request that provides the file location of the uploading file along with a few other parameters. The uploading file location should be inside the directory where the upload handler class is defined. Before 2020.1.330, a crafted web request could result in uploads to arbitrary locations.",
