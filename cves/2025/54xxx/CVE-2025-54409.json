  "description": "AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.",
