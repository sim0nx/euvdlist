  "description": "This vulnerability potentially allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of PaperCut NG. An attacker must have local write access to the C Drive. In addition, Print Archiving must be enabled or the attacker needs to encounter a misconfigured system. This vulnerability does not apply to PaperCut NG installs that have Print Archiving enabled and configured as per the recommended set up procedure. This specific flaw exists within the pc-pdl-to-image process. The process loads an executable from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM\n\nNote: This CVE has been rescored with a \"Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network users on the host server.",
