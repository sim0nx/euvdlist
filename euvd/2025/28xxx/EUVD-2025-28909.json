  "description": "[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the\ntext explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]\n\nThere are two issues related to the mapping of pages belonging to other\ndomains: For one, an assertion is wrong there, where the case actually\nneeds handling.  A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release\nbuild.  This is CVE-2025-58144.\n\nAnd then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually\nobtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can\nnot only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing\ndomain boundaries to be violated.  This is CVE-2025-58145.",
