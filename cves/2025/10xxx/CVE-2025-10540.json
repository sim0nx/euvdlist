  "description": "iMonitor EAM 9.6394 transmits communication between the EAM client agent and the EAM server, as well as between the EAM monitor management software and the server, in plaintext without authentication or encryption. An attacker with network access can intercept sensitive information (such as credentials, keylogger data, and personally identifiable information) and tamper with traffic. This allows both unauthorized disclosure and modification of data, including issuing arbitrary commands to client agents.",
