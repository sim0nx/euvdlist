  "description": "Kenwood DMX958XR JKRadioService Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kenwood DMX958XR. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the JKRadioService. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-26312.",
