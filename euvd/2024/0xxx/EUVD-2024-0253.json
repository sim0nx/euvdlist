  "description": "jupyter-lsp is a coding assistance tool for JupyterLab (code navigation + hover suggestions + linters + autocompletion + rename) using Language Server Protocol. Installations of jupyter-lsp running in environments without configured file system access control (on the operating system level), and with jupyter-server instances exposed to non-trusted network are vulnerable to unauthorised access and modification of file system beyond the jupyter root directory. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should uninstall jupyter-lsp.",
