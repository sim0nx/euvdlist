  "description": "Smartwares cameras\u00a0CIP-37210AT and\u00a0C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, are vulnerable to path traversal. \nWhen an affected device is connected to a mobile app, it opens a port 10000 enabling a user to download pictures shot at specific moments by providing paths to the files. However, the directories to which a user has access are not limited, allowing for path traversal attacks and downloading sensitive information.\nThe vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.",
