  "description": "The 'State' field of the Edit profile page of the LMS by LifterLMS \u2013 Online Course, Membership & Learning Management System Plugin for WordPress plugin before 4.21.1 is not properly sanitised when output in the About section of the profile page, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. This could allow low privilege users (such as students) to elevate their privilege via an XSS attack when an admin will view their profile.",
