  "description": "A vulnerability in the default configuration of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read data from an affected device via SNMP. The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded, read-only community string in the configuration file for the SNMP daemon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static community string in SNMP version 2c queries to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read any data that is accessible via SNMP on the affected device. Note: The static credentials are defined in an internal configuration file and are not visible in the current operation configuration ('running-config') or the startup configuration ('startup-config').
