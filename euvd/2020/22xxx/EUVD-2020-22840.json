  "description": "Cloudflare WARP for Windows allows privilege escalation due to an unquoted service path. A malicious user or process running with non-administrative privileges can become an administrator by abusing the unquoted service path issue. Since version 1.2.2695.1, the vulnerability was fixed by adding quotes around the service's binary path. This issue affects Cloudflare WARP for Windows, versions prior to 1.2.2695.1.",
