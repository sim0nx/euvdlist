  "description": "Penta Security Systems Inc WAPPLES 4.0.*, 5.0.0.*, 5.0.12.* are vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. The operating system that WAPPLES runs on has a built-in non-privileged user penta with a predefined password. The password for this user, as well as its existence, is not disclosed in the documentation. Knowing the credentials, attackers can use this feature to gain uncontrolled access to the device and therefore are considered an undocumented possibility for remote control.",
