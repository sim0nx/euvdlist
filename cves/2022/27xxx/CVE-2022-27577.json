  "description": "The vulnerability in the MSC800 in all versions before 4.15 allows for an attacker to predict the TCP initial sequence number. When the TCP sequence is predictable, an attacker can send packets that are forged to appear to come from a trusted computer. These forged packets could compromise services on the MSC800. SICK has released a new firmware version of the SICK MSC800 and recommends updating to the newest version.",
