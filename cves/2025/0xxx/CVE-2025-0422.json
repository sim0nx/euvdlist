  "description": "An authenticated user in the \"bestinformed Web\" application can execute commands on the underlying server running the application. (Remote Code Execution) For this, the user must be able to create \"ScriptVars\" with the type „script\" and preview them by, for example, creating a new \"Info\". By default, admin users have those permissions, but with the granular permission system, those permissions may be assigned to other users. An attacker is able to execute commands on the server running the \"bestinformed Web\" application if an account with the correct permissions was compromised before.",
