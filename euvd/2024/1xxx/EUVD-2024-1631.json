  "description": "Pterodactyl wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. If the Wings token is leaked either by viewing the node configuration or posting it accidentally somewhere, an attacker can use it to gain arbitrary file write and read access on the node the token is associated to. This issue has been addressed in version 1.11.12 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may enable the `ignore_panel_config_updates` option as a workaround.",
