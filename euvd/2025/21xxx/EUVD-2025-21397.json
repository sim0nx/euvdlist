  "description": "DRACOON is a file sharing service, and the DRACOON Branding Service allows customers to customize their DRACOON interface with their brand. Versions of the DRACOON Branding Service prior to 2.10.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Improper neutralization of input from administrative users could inject HTML code into the workflow for newly onboarded users. A fix was made available in version 2.10.0 and rolled out to the DRACOON service. DRACOON customers do not need to take action.",
