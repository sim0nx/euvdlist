  "description": "The WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom JS module in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied JavaScript code in the Custom JS module. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via the WPBakery Page Builder Custom JS module granted they have access to the WPBakery editor for post types.",
