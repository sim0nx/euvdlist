  "description": "The WP ULike Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the WP_Ulike_Pro_File_Uploader class in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload limited arbitrary files like .php2, .php6, .php7, .phps, .pht, .phtm, .pgif, .shtml, .phar, .inc, .hphp, .ctp, .module, .html, .svg on the affected site's server which may make make other attacks like Cross-Site Scripting possible. Only versions up to 1.8.7 were confirmed vulnerable, however, the earliest tested version for a patch we have access to is 1.9.4, so we are considering 1.9.4 the patched version.",
