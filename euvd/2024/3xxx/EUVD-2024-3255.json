  "description": "Atlantis is a self-hosted golang application that listens for Terraform pull request events via webhooks. Atlantis logs contains GitHub credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on GitHub. When Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization. This was reported in #4060 and fixed in #4667 . The fix was included in Atlantis v0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
