  "description": "Sharp is a content management framework built for Laravel as a package. Prior to 9.11.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component. In affected versions, expressions wrapped in {{ & }} were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field is displayed. The issue has been fixed in v9.11.1 .",
