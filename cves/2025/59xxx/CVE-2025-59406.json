  "description": "The Flock Safety Pisco com.flocksafety.android.pisco application 6.21.11 for Android (installed on Falcon and Sparrow License Plate Readers and Bravo Edge AI Compute Devices) has a cleartext Auth0 client secret in its codebase. Because application binaries can be trivially decompiled or inspected, attackers can recover this OAuth secret without special privileges. This secret is intended to remain confidential and should never be embedded directly in client-side software.",
