  "description": "Parallels Desktop virtio-gpu Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target in a guest system must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the virtio-gpu virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-21260.",
