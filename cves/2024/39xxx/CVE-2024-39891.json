  "description": "In the Twilio Authy API, accessed by Authy Android before 25.1.0 and Authy iOS before 26.1.0, an unauthenticated endpoint provided access to certain phone-number data, as exploited in the wild in June 2024. Specifically, the endpoint accepted a stream of requests containing phone numbers, and responded with information about whether each phone number was registered with Authy. (Authy accounts were not compromised, however.)",
