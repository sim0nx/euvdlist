  "description": "Pion Interceptor is a framework for building RTP/RTCP communication software. Versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor. Users should upgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which validates that: `padLen > 0 && padLen <= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic. If upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload.",
