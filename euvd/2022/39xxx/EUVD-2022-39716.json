  "description": "All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras versions up to and including 1.46.16 are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper input sanitization. An authenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to insert malicious JavaScript code. NOTE: The vendor has stated that with the introduction of firmware version 1.49.16 (Jan 2023) the FLIR AX8 should no longer be affected by the vulnerability reported. Latest firmware version (as of Oct 2025, was released Jun 2024) is 1.55.16.",
