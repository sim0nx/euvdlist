  "description": "An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.",
