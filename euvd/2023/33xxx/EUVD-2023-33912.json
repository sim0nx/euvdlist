  "description": "\nA vulnerability was discovered in the Rockwell Automation Armor PowerFlex device when the product sends communications to the local event log. Threat actors could exploit this vulnerability by sending an influx of network commands, causing the product to generate an influx of event log traffic at a high rate. If exploited, the product would stop normal operations and self-reset creating a denial-of-service condition. The error code would need to be cleared prior to resuming normal operations.\n\n",
