  "description": "NVIDIA GeForce Experience, all versions prior to 3.23, contains a vulnerability in the login flow when a user tries to log in by using a browser, while, at the same time, any other web page is loaded in other tabs of the same browser. In this situation, the web page can get access to the token of the user login session, leading to the possibility that the user\u2019s account is compromised. This may lead to the targeted user\u2019s data being accessed, altered, or lost.",
