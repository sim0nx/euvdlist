  "description": "Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSOD\u00a0with a parallel thread changing the memory\u2019s access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing the\u00a0userspace to change page permissions half way through the routine.\u00a0 A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.",
