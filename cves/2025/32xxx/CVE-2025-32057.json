  "description": "The Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch which is installed in Nissan Leaf ZE1 \u2013 2020 uses a Redbend service for over-the-air provisioning and updates. HTTPS is used for communication with the back-end server. Due to usage of the default configuration for the underlying SSL engine, the server root certificate is not verified. As a result, an attacker may be able to impersonate a Redbend backend server using a self-signed certificate.\n\n\n\nFirst identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020.",
