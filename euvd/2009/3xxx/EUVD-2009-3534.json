  "description": "In RHEV-M VDC 2.2.0, it was found that the SSL certificate was not verified when using the client-side Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager interface (a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) XAML browser application) to connect to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, tricking the user into thinking they are viewing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager when the content is actually attacker-controlled, or modifying actions a user requested Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to perform.",
