  "description": "PowerPoint in Microsoft Office 2003 does not properly handle a container object whose position value exceeds the record length, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and application crash) via a crafted PowerPoint (.PPT) file, as demonstrated by Nanika.ppt, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-3435, CVE-2006-3876, CVE-2006-3877, and CVE-2006-4694. NOTE: the impact of this issue was originally claimed to be arbitrary code execution, but later analysis demonstrated that this was erroneous.",
