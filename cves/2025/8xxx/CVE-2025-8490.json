  "description": "The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Import in all versions up to, and including, 7.97 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
