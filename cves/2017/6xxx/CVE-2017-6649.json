  "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software 7.1 through 7.3 running on Cisco Nexus Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files at the user's privilege level outside of the user's path. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb86787, CSCve60516, CSCve60555.",
