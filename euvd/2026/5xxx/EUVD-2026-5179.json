  "description": "Craft Commerce is an ecommerce platform for Craft CMS. In versions from 4.0.0-RC1 to 4.10.0 and from 5.0.0 to 5.5.1, a stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator\u2019s browser. This occurs because the 'Address Line 1' field in Inventory Locations is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the admin panel. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.1 and 5.5.2.",
