  "description": "1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.",
