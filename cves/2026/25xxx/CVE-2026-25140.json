  "description": "apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages. From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.1, an attacker who controls or compromises an APK repository used by apko could cause resource exhaustion on the build host. The ExpandApk function in pkg/apk/expandapk/expandapk.go expands .apk streams without enforcing decompression limits, allowing a malicious repository to serve a small, highly-compressed .apk that inflates into a large tar stream, consuming excessive disk space and CPU time, causing build failures or denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1.",
