  "description": "The Admin in English with Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the enable_eng function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify administrator language settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
