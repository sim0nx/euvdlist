  "description": "Insecure handling of GET header parameter file\u00a0included in requests being sent to an instance of the\u00a0open-source project\u00a0Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which \u2013 when visited by a user \u2013 will send malicious\u00a0requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause one of the following (depending on the chosen payload): shell command execution, reflected XSS or cross-site request forgery.\n\n\nThis issue affects Phoniebox in all releases through 2.7. Newer 2.x releases were not tested, but they might also be vulnerable.\u00a0\nPhoniebox in version 3.0 and higher are not affected.",
