  "description": "Mautic before 3.2.4 is affected by stored XSS. An attacker with access to Social Monitoring, an application feature, could attack other users, including administrators. For example, an attacker could load an externally drafted JavaScript file that would allow them to eventually perform actions on the target user\u2019s behalf, including changing the user\u2019s password or email address or changing the attacker\u2019s user role from a low-privileged user to an administrator account.",
