  "description": "October is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. This issue affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.5.15.",
