  "description": "Altium 365 workspace endpoints were configured with an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy that allowed credentialed cross-origin requests from other Altium-controlled subdomains, including forum.live.altium.com. As a result, JavaScript executing on those origins could access authenticated workspace APIs in the context of a logged-in user. When chained with vulnerabilities in those external applications, this misconfiguration enables unauthorized access to workspace data, administrative actions, and bypass of IP allowlisting controls, including in GovCloud environments.",
