  "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Samsung Galaxy S21 prior to 4.5.40.5 phones. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of redirections. An attacker can force a redirection to a site that serves malicious content. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-15918.",
