  "description": "An issue was discovered in Tyto Sahi Pro 6.x through 8.0.0. TestRunner_Non_distributed (and distributed end points) does not have any authentication mechanism. This allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary script on the remote Sahi Pro server. There is also a password-protected web interface intended for remote access to scripts. This web interface lacks server-side validation, which allows an attacker to create/modify/delete a script remotely without any password. Chaining both of these issues results in remote code execution on the Sahi Pro server.",
