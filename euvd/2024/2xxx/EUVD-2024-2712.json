  "description": "Tina is an open-source content management system (CMS). Sites building with Tina CMS's command line interface (CLI) prior to version 1.6.2 that use a search token may be vulnerable to the search token being leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json). Administrators of Tina-enabled websites with search setup should rotate their key immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli version 1.6.2. Upgrading and rotating the search token is required for the proper fix.",
