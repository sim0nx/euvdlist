  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the get_finderinfo method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
