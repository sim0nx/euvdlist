  "description": "Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Ozone.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to download metadata internal to the Storage Container Manager service without proper authentication.\nThe attacker is not allowed to do any modification within the Ozone Storage Container Manager service using this vulnerability.\nThe accessible metadata does not contain sensitive information that can be used to exploit the system later on, and the accessible data does not make it possible to gain access to actual user data within Ozone.\nThis issue affects Apache Ozone: 1.2.0 and subsequent releases up until 1.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.4.0, which fixes the issue.",
