  "description": "A vulnerability in the restricted shell of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, local attacker to identify directories and write arbitrary files to the file system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent to a CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to identify file directories on the affected device and write arbitrary files to the file system on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated shell user.",
