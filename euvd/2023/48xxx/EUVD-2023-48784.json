User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSP files. Crafted data in a PSP file can trigger an off-by-one error when calculating a location to write within a heap-based buffer.
