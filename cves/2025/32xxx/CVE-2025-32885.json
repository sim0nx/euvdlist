  "description": "An issue was discovered on goTenna v1 devices with app 5.5.3 and firmware 0.25.5. The app there makes it possible to inject any custom message (into existing v1 networks) with any GID and Callsign via a software defined radio. This can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.",
