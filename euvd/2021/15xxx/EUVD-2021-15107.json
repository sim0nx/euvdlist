  "description": "File upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS before 1.0.0-beta.3 via uploading a .htaccess and *.hello files using the Media Files upload functionality. The original file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-27387) was remediated by restricting the PHP extensions; however, we confirmed that the filter was bypassed via uploading an arbitrary .htaccess and *.hello files in order to execute PHP code to gain RCE.",
