  "description": "The Photo Gallery by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018image_id\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.34 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an administrative user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
