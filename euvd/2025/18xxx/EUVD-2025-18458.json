  "description": "Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.0, the pyproject.toml lists conda-index as a Python dependency. This package is not published in PyPI. An attacker could claim this namespace and upload arbitrary (malicious) code to the package, and then exploit pip install commands by injecting the malicious dependency in the solve. This issue has been fixed in version 25.3.0. A workaround involves using --no-deps for pip install-ing the project from the repository.",
