  "description": "A missing authentication vulnerability in Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Services (WFBSS) agent could have allowed an unauthenticated attacker to remotely take control of the agent on affected installations.\r\n\r\nAlso note: this vulnerability only affected the SaaS client version of WFBSS only, meaning the on-premise version of Worry-Free Business Security was not affected, and this issue was addressed in a WFBSS monthly maintenance update. Therefore no other customer action is required to mitigate if the WFBSS agents are on the regular SaaS maintenance deployment schedule and this disclosure is for informational purposes only.",
