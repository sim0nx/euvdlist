  "description": "The WP 2FA with Telegram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to insufficient validation of the user-controlled key on the 'validate_tg' action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.",
