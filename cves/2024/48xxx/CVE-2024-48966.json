  "description": "The software tools used by service personnel to test & calibrate the ventilator do not support user authentication. An attacker with access to the Service PC where the tools are installed could obtain diagnostic information through the test tool or manipulate the ventilator's settings and embedded software via the calibration tool, without having to authenticate to either tool. This could result in unauthorized disclosure of information and/or have unintended impacts on device settings and performance.",
