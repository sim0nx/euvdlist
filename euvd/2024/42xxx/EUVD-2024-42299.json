  "description": "** DISPUTED ** CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-filters provides backends, filters, and other software for CUPS 2.x to use on non-Mac OS systems. Any value passed to `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` via a PPD file will be executed as a user controlled command. When combined with other logic bugs as described in CVE-2024-47176, this can lead to remote command execution.\n\nThis vulnerability has been disputed by a third party because `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` is functionality that is intended to execute administrator specified code.",
