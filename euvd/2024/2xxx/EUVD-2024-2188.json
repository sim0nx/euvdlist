  "description": "DeepJavaLibrary(DJL) is an Engine-Agnostic Deep Learning Framework in Java. DJL versions 0.1.0 through 0.27.0 do not prevent absolute path archived artifacts from inserting archived files directly into the system, overwriting system files. This is fixed in DJL 0.28.0 and patched in DJL Large Model Inference containers version 0.27.0. Users are advised to upgrade.",
