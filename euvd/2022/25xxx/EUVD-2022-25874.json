  "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming CFSoIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CFSoIP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
