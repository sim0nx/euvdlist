  "description": "A vulnerability in the web management GUI of the Cisco D9800 Network Transport Receiver could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of GUI command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted arguments into a vulnerable GUI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying BusyBox operating system. These commands are run at the privilege level of the authenticated user. The attacker needs valid device credentials for this attack. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg74691.",
