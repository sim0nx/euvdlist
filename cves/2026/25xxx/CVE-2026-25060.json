  "description": "OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to 4.1.10, certificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications. The TlsInsecureSkipVerify setting is default to true in the DefaultConfig() function in internal/conf/config.go. This vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10.",
