  "description": "A vulnerability in the ACS Report component of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. Commands executed by the attacker are processed at the targeted user's privilege level. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the Action Message Format (AMF) protocol. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted AMF message that contains malicious code to a targeted user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the ACS device. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco Secure ACS prior to Release 5.8 Patch 7. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve69037.",
