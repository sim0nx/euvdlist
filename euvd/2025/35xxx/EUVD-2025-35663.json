  "description": "A flaw was found in the asynchronous message queue handling of the libsoup library, widely used by GNOME and WebKit-based applications to manage HTTP/2 communications. When network operations are aborted at specific timing intervals, an internal message queue item may be freed twice due to missing state synchronization. This leads to a use-after-free memory access, potentially crashing the affected application. Attackers could exploit this behavior remotely by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
