  "description": "An unrestricted file-upload issue in EditLaunchPadDialog.aspx in Ivanti Endpoint Manager 2019.1 and 2020.1 allows an authenticated attacker to gain remote code execution by uploading a malicious aspx file. The issue is caused by insufficient file extension validation and insecure file operations on the uploaded image, which upon failure will leave the temporarily created files in an accessible location on the server.",
