  "description": "D3D Wi-Fi Home Security System ZX-G12 v2.1.17 is susceptible to RF jamming on the 433 MHz alarm sensor channel. An attacker within RF range can transmit continuous interference to block sensor transmissions, resulting in missed alarms and loss of security monitoring. The device lacks jamming detection or mitigations, creating a denial-of-service condition that may lead to undetected intrusions or failure to trigger safety alerts.",
