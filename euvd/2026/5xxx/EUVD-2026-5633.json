  "description": "OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. OpenFGA v1.8.5 to v1.11.2 ( openfga-0.2.22<= Helm chart <= openfga-0.2.51, v.1.8.5 <= docker <= v.1.11.2) are vulnerable to improper policy enforcement when certain Check calls are executed. The vulnerability requires a model that has a a relation directly assignable by a type bound public access and assignable by type bound non-public access, a tuple assigned for the relation that is a type bound public access, a tuple assigned for the same object with the same relation that is not type bound public access, and a tuple assigned for a different object that has an object ID lexicographically larger with the same user and relation which is not type bound public access. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.11.3.",
