  "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid administrator or privilege level 15 credentials to load a virtual service image and bypass signature verification on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper signature verification during the installation of an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image. An authenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability and load a malicious, unsigned OVA image on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform code execution on a crafted software OVA image.",
