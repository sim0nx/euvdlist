  "description": "The Professional Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the watch_for_contact_form_submit function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger test email sending via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
