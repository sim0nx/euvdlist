  "description": "apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages. From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.1, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in apko's dirFS filesystem abstraction. An attacker who can supply a malicious APK package (e.g., via a compromised or typosquatted repository) could create directories or symlinks outside the intended installation root. The MkdirAll, Mkdir, and Symlink methods in pkg/apk/fs/rwosfs.go use filepath.Join() without validating that the resulting path stays within the base directory. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1.",
