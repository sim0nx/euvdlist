  "description": "Multiple interpretation error in ArcaVir 2005 package 2005-06-21 allows remote attackers to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an \"MZ\" magic byte sequence which is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type that could still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end system, as demonstrated by a \"triple headed\" program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the \"magic byte bug.\"",
