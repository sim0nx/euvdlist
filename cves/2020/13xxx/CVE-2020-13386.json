  "description": "In SmartDraw 2020 27.0.0.0, the installer gives inherited write permissions to the Authenticated Users group on the SmartDraw 2020 installation folder. Additionally, when the product is installed, two scheduled tasks are created on the machine, SDMsgUpdate (Local) and SDMsgUpdate (TE). The scheduled tasks run in the context of the user who installed the product. Both scheduled tasks attempt to run the same binary, C:\\SmartDraw 2020\\Messages\\SDNotify.exe. The folder Messages doesn't exist by default and (by extension) neither does SDNotify.exe. Due to the weak folder permissions, these can be created by any user. A malicious actor can therefore create a malicious SDNotify.exe binary, and have it automatically run, whenever the user who installed the product logs on to the machine. The malicious SDNotify.exe could, for example, create a new local administrator account on the machine.",
