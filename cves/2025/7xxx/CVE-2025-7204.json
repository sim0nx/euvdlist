  "description": "In ConnectWise PSA versions older than 2025.9, a\nvulnerability exists where authenticated users could gain access to sensitive\nuser information. Specific API requests were found to return an overly verbose\nuser object, which included encrypted password hashes for other users.\nAuthenticated users could then retrieve these hashes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAn\nattacker or privileged user could then use these exposed hashes to conduct\noffline brute-force or dictionary attacks. Such attacks could lead to\ncredential compromise, allowing unauthorized access to accounts, and\npotentially privilege escalation within the system.",
