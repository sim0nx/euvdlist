  "description": "gosnowflake is th Snowflake Golang driver. Prior to version 1.6.19, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.",
