  "description": "The API used to interact with documents in the application contains two endpoints with a flaw that allows an authenticated attacker to write a file with controlled contents to an arbitrary location on the underlying file system. This can be used to facilitate RCE. An account with \u2018read\u2019 and \u2018write\u2019 privileges on at least one existing document in the application is required to exploit the vulnerability.\u00a0Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to run commands of their choosing on the underlying operating system of the web server running LogicalDOC.",
