  "description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The \"defer\" servlet offers to redirect a client to a specified URL. Since some checks were missing, arbitrary URLs could be provided as redirection target. Users can be tricked to follow a link to a trustworthy domain but end up at an unexpected service later on. This vulnerability can be used to prepare and enhance phishing attacks.",
