  "description": "Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools and a WebAPI. In affected versions access to two URLs used in both Rundeck Open Source and Process Automation products could allow authenticated users to access the URL path, which would allow access to view or delete jobs, without the necessary authorization checks. This issue has been addressed in version 4.17.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n",
