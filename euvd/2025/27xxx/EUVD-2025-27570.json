  "description": "The Responsive Filterable Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the HdnMediaSelection_image field in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
