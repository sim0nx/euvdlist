  "description": "ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter SIP Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SIP calls. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-28303.",
