  "description": "ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter SIP INVITE Alert-Info Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the Alert-Info header of SIP INVITE requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-28301.",
