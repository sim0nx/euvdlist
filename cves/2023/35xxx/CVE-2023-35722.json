This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of UPnP port mapping requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
