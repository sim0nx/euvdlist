  "description": "One Identity by Quest Safeguard for Privileged Passwords Appliance 7.5.1.20903 is vulnerable to One Time Password (OTP)/Multifactor Authentication (MFA) bypass using response manipulation. An attacker who intercepts or captures a valid OTP response can bypass the OTP verification step by replaying the same response. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because, by design, the product successfully authenticates a client that possesses a cookie whose validity time interval includes the current time, and thus authentication after any type of \"interception\" is not a violation of the security model. (The cookie has the HttpOnly attribute.)",
