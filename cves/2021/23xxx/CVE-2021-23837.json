  "description": "An issue was discovered in flatCore before 2.0.0 build 139. A time-based blind SQL injection was identified in the selected_folder HTTP request body parameter for the acp interface. The affected parameter (which retrieves the file contents of the specified folder) was found to be accepting malicious user input without proper sanitization, thus leading to SQL injection. Database related information can be successfully retrieved.",
