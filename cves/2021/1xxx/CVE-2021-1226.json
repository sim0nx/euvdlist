  "description": "A vulnerability in the audit logging component of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service, Cisco Unity Connection, Cisco Emergency Responder, and Cisco Prime License Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.",
