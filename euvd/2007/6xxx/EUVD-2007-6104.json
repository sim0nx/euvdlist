  "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpslideshow.php in PHPSlideShow 0.9.9.2, and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the directory parameter. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for toonchapter8.php, but this is probably a site-specific name, since the PHPSlideShow distribution does not contain that file.",
