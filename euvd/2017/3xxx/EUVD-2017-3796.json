  "description": "A vulnerability in the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) code of Cisco IR800 Integrated Services Router Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to boot an unsigned Hypervisor on an affected device and compromise the integrity of the system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input. An attacker who can access an affected router via the console could exploit this vulnerability by entering ROMMON mode and modifying ROMMON variables. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and install a malicious version of Hypervisor firmware on an affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb44027.",
