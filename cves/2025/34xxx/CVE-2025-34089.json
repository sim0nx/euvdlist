  "description": "An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote for Mac, a macOS remote control utility developed by Aexol Studio, in versions up to and including 2025.7. When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the \"Allow unknown devices\" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.",
