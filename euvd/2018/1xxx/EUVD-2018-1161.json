  "description": "A vulnerability in the role-based access-checking mechanisms of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software lacks proper input and validation checks for certain file systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing crafted commands in the CLI of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause other users to execute unwanted arbitrary commands on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf52994.",
