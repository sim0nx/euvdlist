  "description": "Discourse Policy plugin gives the ability to confirm users have seen or done something. Prior to version 0.1.1, if there was a policy posted to a public topic that was tied to a private group then the group members could be shown to non-group members. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1. A workaround involves moving any policy topics with private groups to restricted categories.",
