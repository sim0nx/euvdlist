  "description": "GLPI is a free Asset and IT management software package. In versions prior to 9.5.6, a user who is logged in to GLPI can bypass Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in many places. This could allow a malicious actor to perform many actions on GLPI. This issue is fixed in version 9.5.6. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.",
