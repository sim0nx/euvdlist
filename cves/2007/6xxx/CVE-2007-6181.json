  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in cygwin1.dll in Cygwin 1.5.7 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a filename with a certain length, as demonstrated by a remote authenticated user who uses the SCP protocol to send a file to the Cygwin machine, and thereby causes scp.exe on this machine to execute, and then overwrite heap memory with characters from the filename. NOTE: it is also reported that a related issue might exist in 1.5.7 through 1.5.19.",
