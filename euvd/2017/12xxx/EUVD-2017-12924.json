Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed firewall mode only and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 or IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP connection is needed to perform the attack. The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Clientless SSL VPN portal.
