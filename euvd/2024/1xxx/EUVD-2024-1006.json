  "description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Archiva.\n\nApache Archiva has a setting to disable user registration, however this restriction can be bypassed. As Apache Archiva has been retired, we do not expect to release a version of Apache Archiva that fixes this issue. You are recommended to look into migrating to a different solution, or isolate your instance from any untrusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer",
