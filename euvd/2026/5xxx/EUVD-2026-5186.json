  "description": "Craft Commerce is an ecommerce platform for Craft CMS. In versions from 4.0.0-RC1 to 4.10.0 and from 5.0.0 to 5.5.1, a stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator\u2019s browser. This occurs because the Shipping Zone (Name & Description) fields in the Store Management section are not properly sanitized before being displayed in the admin panel. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.1 and 5.5.2.",
