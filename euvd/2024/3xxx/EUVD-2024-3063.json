  "description": "ssoready is a single sign on provider implemented via docker. Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
