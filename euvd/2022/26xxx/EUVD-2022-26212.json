  "description": "A vulnerability in the Localdisk Management feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to make unauthorized changes to the file system of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with absolute path sequences. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations within the file system. Using this method, it is possible to access the underlying operating system and execute commands with system privileges.",
