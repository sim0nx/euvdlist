  "description": "\nAs noted in the \u201cVTPM.md\u201d file in the eve documentation, \u201cVTPM is a server listening on port\n8877 in EVE, exposing limited functionality of the TPM to the clients. \nVTPM allows clients to\nexecute tpm2-tools binaries from a list of hardcoded options\u201d\nThe communication with this server is done using protobuf, and the data is comprised of 2\nparts:\n\n1. Header\n\n2. Data\n\nWhen a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will be the header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come.\n\nThen, in the function \u201chandleRequest\u201d this size is then used in order to allocate a payload on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant process with freely controlled data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n* An attacker can gain control over the system, specifically on the \u201cvtpm_server\u201d process\nwhich has very high privileges.\n\n\n",
