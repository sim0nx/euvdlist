  "description": "Endress+Hauser Ecograph T (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG35, ORSG35) and Memograph M (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG45, ORSG45) with Firmware version V2.0.0 and above is prone to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. The firmware release has a dynamic token for each request submitted to the server, which makes repeating requests and analysis complex enough. Nevertheless, it's possible and during the analysis it was discovered that it also has an issue with the access-control matrix on the server-side. It was found that a user with low rights can get information from endpoints that should not be available to this user.",
