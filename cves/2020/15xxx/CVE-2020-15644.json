  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole 5.5.0.64. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the setAppFileBytes method of the GWTTestServiceImpl class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-10550.",
