  "description": "The WP Job Portal \u2013 A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion, Arbitrary Settings Update, and User Creation in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 via several functions called by the 'checkFormRequest' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201csafe\u201d file types can be uploaded and included. Attackers can also update arbitrary settings and create user accounts even when registration is disabled, leading to user creation with a default role of Administrator.",
