  "description": "A vulnerability in an access control mechanism of Cisco Cyber Vision Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and access internal services that are running on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient enforcement of access control in the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the internal services of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to impact monitoring of sensors that are managed by the software.",
