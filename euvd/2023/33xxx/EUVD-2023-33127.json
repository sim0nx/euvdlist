  "description": "Code Sector TeraCopy 3.9.7 does not perform proper access validation on the source folder during a copy operation. This leads to Arbitrary File Read by allowing any user to copy any directory in the system to a directory they control. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this because only admin users can copy arbitrary folders, and because the 143984 reference is about a different concern (unrelated to directory copying) that was fixed in 3.5b.",
