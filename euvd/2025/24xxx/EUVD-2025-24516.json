  "description": "Substance3D - Modeler versions 1.22.0 and earlier are affected by an Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. If the application uses an uncontrolled search path to locate critical resources such as programs, an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.",
