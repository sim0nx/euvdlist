  "description": "Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. Through the store-api it is possible as a attacker to check if a specific e-mail address has an account in the shop. Using the store-api endpoint /store-api/account/recovery-password you get the response, which indicates clearly that there is no account for this customer. In contrast you get a success response if the account was found. This vulnerability is fixed in Shopware 6.6.10.3 or 6.5.8.17. For older versions of 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.",
