  "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `BlockLSTMGradV2` does not fully validate its inputs. This results in a a segfault that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 2a458fc4866505be27c62f81474ecb2b870498fa. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
