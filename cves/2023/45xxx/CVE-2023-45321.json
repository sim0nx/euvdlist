  "description": "The Android Client application, when enrolled with the define  method 1 (the user manually inserts the server ip address), use HTTP protocol to retrieve sensitive information (ip address and credentials to connect to a remote MQTT broker entity) instead of HTTPS and this feature is not configurable by the user. Due to the lack of encryption of HTTP,this issue allows an attacker placed in the same subnet network of the HMI device to intercept username and password necessary to authenticate to the MQTT server responsible to implement the remote management protocol.",
