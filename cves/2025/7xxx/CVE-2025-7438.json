  "description": "The MasterStudy LMS Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'install_and_activate_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability is difficult to exploit due to timing requirements and environmental factors.",
