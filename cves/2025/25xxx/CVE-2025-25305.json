  "description": "Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
