  "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in the EmChartBean server side component for Oracle Application Server 10g allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unknown vectors, probably \"\\..\" sequences in the beanId parameter.  NOTE: this is likely a duplicate of another CVE that Oracle addressed in CPU Jan 2007, but due to lack of details by Oracle, it is unclear which BugID this issue is associated with, so the other CVE cannot be determined.  Possibilities include EM02 (CVE-2007-0292) or EM05 (CVE-2007-0293).",
