An unauthenticated attacker can therefore\u00a0upload a new TLS/SSL certificate replacing the trusted root used by the appliance, delete an existing certificate causing immediate loss of trust for services that rely on it, or download any stored CA or client certificate via the service\u2011clients endpoint which also suffers an IDOR that allows enumeration of all client IDs.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-028 \u2014 Unauthenticated Admin APIs Used to Modify SSL Certificates.",
