  "description": "FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte responsible for managing entities and administering workflow executions. Prior to version 1.1.124, list endpoints on FlyteAdmin have a SQL vulnerability where a malicious user can send a REST request with custom SQL statements as list filters. The attacker needs to have access to the FlyteAdmin installation, typically either behind a VPN or authentication. Version 1.1.124 contains a patch for this issue.",
