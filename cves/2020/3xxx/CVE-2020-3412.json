  "description": "A vulnerability in the scheduled meeting template feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to create a scheduled meeting template that would belong to another user in their organization. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for the creation of scheduled meeting templates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to create a scheduled meeting template. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create a scheduled meeting template that would belong to a user other than themselves.",
