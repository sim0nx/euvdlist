  "description": "The Ultimate Multi Design Video Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
