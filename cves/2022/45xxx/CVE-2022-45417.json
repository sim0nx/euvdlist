  "description": "Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode. This would not have persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode details to disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107.",
