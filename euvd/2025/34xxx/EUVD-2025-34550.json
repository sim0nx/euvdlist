  "description": "The Theme Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation when processing form submissions in the theme-importer.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger arbitrary file downloads and potentially execute malicious operations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
