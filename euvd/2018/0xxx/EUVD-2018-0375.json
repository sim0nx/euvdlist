  "description": "st is a module for serving static files. An attacker is able to craft a request that results in an HTTP 301 (redirect) to an entirely different domain. A request for: http://some.server.com//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e would result in a 301 to //nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e which most browsers treat as a proper redirect as // is translated into the current schema being used. Mitigating factor: In order for this to work, st must be serving from the root of a server (/) rather than the typical sub directory (/static/) and the redirect URL will end with some form of URL encoded .. (\"%2e%2e\", \"%2e.\", \".%2e\").",
