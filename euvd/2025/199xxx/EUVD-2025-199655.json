  "description": "WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime. Prior to version 2.4.4, an out-of-bounds array access issue exists in WAMR's fast interpreter mode during WASM bytecode loading. When frame_ref_bottom and frame_offset_bottom arrays are at capacity and a GET_GLOBAL(I32) opcode is encountered, frame_ref_bottom is expanded but frame_offset_bottom may not be. If this is immediately followed by an if opcode that triggers preserve_local_for_block, the function traverses arrays using stack_cell_num as the upper bound, causing out-of-bounds access to frame_offset_bottom since it wasn't expanded to match the increased stack_cell_num. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.4.",
