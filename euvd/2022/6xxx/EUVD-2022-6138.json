  "description": "We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the 1.28.2 release.  In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler.  This is fixed in 1.28.3.",
