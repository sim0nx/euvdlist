  "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Training could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to join a password-protected meeting without providing the meeting password. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to API requests that are a part of meeting join flow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an API request to the application, which would return a URL that includes a meeting join page that is prepopulated with the meeting username and password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join the password-protected meeting. The attacker would be visible in the attendee list of the meeting.",
