  "description": "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.12.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the maybe_opt_in() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to opt an affected site into usage statistics collection via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
