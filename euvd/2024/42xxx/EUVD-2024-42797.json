  "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
