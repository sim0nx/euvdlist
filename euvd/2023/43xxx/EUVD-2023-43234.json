  "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration, device name related to the datasource etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.",
