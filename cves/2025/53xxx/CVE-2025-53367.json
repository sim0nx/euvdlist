  "description": "DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.",
