  "description": "CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. In versions 2.2.0 through 2.54.0, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim user's CVAT UI session, provided that they are able to create a maliciously crafted label in a CVAT task or project, then get the victim user to either edit that label, or view a shape that refers to that label; and/or get the victim user to upload a maliciously crafted SVG image when configuring a skeleton. This gives the attacker temporary access to all CVAT resources that the victim user can access. Version 2.55.0 fixes the issue.",
