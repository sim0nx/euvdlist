  "description": "Redis before 6cbea7d allows a replica to cause an assertion failure in a primary server by sending a non-administrative command (specifically, a SET command). NOTE: this was fixed for Redis 6.2.x and 7.x in 2021. Versions before 6.2 were not intended to have safety guarantees related to this.",
