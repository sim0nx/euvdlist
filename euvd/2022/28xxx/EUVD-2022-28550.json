In addition to user preferences, such configurations contain hashed passwords (brypt with cost 9, salted) of FreshRSS Web interface. If the API is used, the configuration might contain a hashed password (brypt with cost 9, salted) of the GReader API, and a hashed password (MD5 salted) of the Fever API.
