  "description": "Substance3D - Painter versions 10.1.0 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.",
