  "description": "A vulnerability in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows could allow an remote attacker to enumerate domain user accounts.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to compare the response time that are returned by the affected system to determine which accounts are valid user accounts. Affected systems are only vulnerable if they have LDAP configured.\n\nThe affected URI is /internal_forms_authentication/ the response time of the form is longer if the supplied user does not exists and shorter if the user exists.",
