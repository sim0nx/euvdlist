  "description": "The web server of the Access Manager offers a functionality to download a backup of the local database stored on the device. This database contains the whole configuration. This includes encrypted MIFARE keys, card data, user PINs and much more. The PINs are even stored unencrypted. Combined with the fact that an attacker can easily get access to the backup functionality by abusing the session management issue (CVE-2025-59101), or by exploiting the weak default password (CVE-2025-59108), or by simply setting a new password without prior authentication via the SOAP API (CVE-2025-59097), it is easily possible to access the sensitive data on the device.",
