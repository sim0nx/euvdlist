  "description": "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .\\n\\nApache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to\\nhandle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines\\na YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming\\nYAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method\\nis invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.\\n \\nWe have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.\\nThis issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.\u00a0Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.\\nIf using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.\\n\\n",
