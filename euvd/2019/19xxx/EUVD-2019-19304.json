  "description": "Western Digital My Cloud, My Cloud Mirror Gen2, My Cloud EX2 Ultra, My Cloud EX2100, My Cloud EX4100, My Cloud DL2100, My Cloud DL4100, My Cloud PR2100 and My Cloud PR4100 firmware before 2.31.174 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The login_mgr.cgi file checks credentials against /etc/shadow. However, the \"nobody\" account (which can be used to access the control panel API as a low-privilege logged-in user) has a default empty password, allowing an attacker to modify the My Cloud EX2 Ultra web page source code and obtain access to the My Cloud as a non-Admin My Cloud device user.",
