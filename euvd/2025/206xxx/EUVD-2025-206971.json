  "description": "The LatePoint \u2013 Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5. This is due to the 'call_by_route_name' function in the routing layer only validating user capabilities without enforcing nonce verification. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform multiple administrative actions via forged requests granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
