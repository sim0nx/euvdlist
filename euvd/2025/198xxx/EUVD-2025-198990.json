  "description": "Sentry-Javascript is an official Sentry SDKs for JavaScript. From version 10.11.0 to before 10.27.0, when a Node.js application using the Sentry SDK has sendDefaultPii: true it is possible to inadvertently send certain sensitive HTTP headers, including the Cookie header, to Sentry. Those headers would be stored within a Sentry organization as part of the associated trace. A person with access to the Sentry organization could then view and use these sensitive values to impersonate or escalate their privileges within the application. This issue has been patched in version 10.27.0.",
