  "description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0. An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave) can recover an RSA private key after observing the victim performing a single private-key operation, if the window size (MBEDTLS_MPI_WINDOW_SIZE) used for the exponentiation is 3 or smaller.",
