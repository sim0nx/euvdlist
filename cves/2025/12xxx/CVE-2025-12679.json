  "description": "A vulnerability in Brocade SANnav before 2.4.0b prints the \nPassword-Based Encryption (PBE) key in plaintext in the system audit log\n file. The vulnerability could allow a remote authenticated attacker \nwith access to the audit logs to access the pbe key.\n\nNote: The vulnerability is only triggered during a migration and not \nin a new installation. The system audit logs are accessible only to a \nprivileged user on the server.\n\n\n\nThese audit logs are the local server VM\u2019s audit logs and are not \ncontrolled by SANnav. These logs are only visible to the server admin of\n the host server and are not visible to the SANnav admin or any SANnav \nuser.",
