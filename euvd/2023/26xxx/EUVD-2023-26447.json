  "description": "On versions beginning in 7.1.5 to before 7.2.3.1, a DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in the BIG-IP Edge Client for Windows. User interaction and administrative privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability because the victim user needs to run the executable on the system and the attacker requires administrative privileges for modifying the files in the trusted search path.  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n",
