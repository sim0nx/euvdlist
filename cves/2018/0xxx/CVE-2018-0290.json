  "description": "A vulnerability in the TCP stack of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the notification system. The vulnerability is due to faulty handling of new TCP connections to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious TCP packet to the vulnerable service. An exploit could allow the attacker to create a DoS condition by interrupting certain phone services. A manual restart of the service may be required to restore full functionalities.
