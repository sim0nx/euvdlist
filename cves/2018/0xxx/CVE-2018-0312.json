  "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packet headers when the software processes packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition on the device. This vulnerability affects the following if configured to use Cisco Fabric Services: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
