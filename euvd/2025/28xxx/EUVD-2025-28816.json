  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in Scada-LTS 2.7.8.1. This impacts an unknown function of the file scheduled_events.shtm. Such manipulation of the argument alias leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be executed remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor explains: \"[T]he risks of indicated vulnerabilities seem to be minimal as all scenarios likely require admin permissions. Moreover, regardless our team fixes those vulnerabilities - the overall risk change to the user due to malicious admin actions will not be lower. An admin user - by definition - has full control over HTML and JS code that is delivered to users in regular synoptic panels. In other words - due to the design of the system it is not possible to limit the admin user to attack the users.\"",
