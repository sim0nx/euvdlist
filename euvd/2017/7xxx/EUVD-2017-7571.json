  "description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is due to a computation that accesses a pointer that has not been initialized in the main DLL. In this case, a computation defines a read from an unexpected memory location. Therefore, an attacker might be able to read sensitive portions of memory.",
