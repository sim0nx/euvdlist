  "description": "D-Link DAP-1360 webupg UPGCGI_CheckAuth Numeric Truncation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1360 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of requests to the /cgi-bin/webupg endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-18423.",
