  "description": "The Log HTTP Requests plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via logged HTTP requests in versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who can trick a site's administrator into performing an action like clicking on a link, or an authenticated user with access to a page that sends a request using user-supplied data via the server, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
