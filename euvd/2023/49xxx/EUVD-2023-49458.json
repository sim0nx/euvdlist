Affected versions of Nextcloud stored OAuth2 tokens in plaintext which allows an attacker who has gained access to the server to potentially elevate their privilege. This issue has been addressed and users are recommended to upgrade their Nextcloud Server to version 25.0.8, 26.0.3 or 27.0.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
