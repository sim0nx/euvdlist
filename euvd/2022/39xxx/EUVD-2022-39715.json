  "description": "All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including 1.46.16 are affected by an insecure design vulnerability due to an improper directory access restriction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by sending a URI that contains the path of the SQLite users database and download it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to extract usernames and hashed passwords. NOTE: The vendor has stated that with the introduction of firmware version 1.49.16 (Jan 2023) the FLIR AX8 should no longer be affected by the vulnerability reported. Latest firmware version (as of Oct 2025, was released Jun 2024) is 1.55.16.",
