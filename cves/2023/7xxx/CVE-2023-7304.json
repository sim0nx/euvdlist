  "description": "Ruijie RG-UAC Application Management Gateway contains a command injection vulnerability via the 'nmc_sync.php' interface.\u00a0An unauthenticated attacker able to reach the affected endpoint can inject shell commands via crafted request data, causing the application to execute arbitrary commands on the host. Successful exploitation can yield full control of the application process and may lead to system-level access depending on the service privileges. VulnCheck has observed this vulnerability being targeted by the RondoDox botnet campaign.",
