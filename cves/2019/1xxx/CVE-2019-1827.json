  "description": "A vulnerability in the Online Help web service of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the service. The vulnerability exists because the Online Help web service of an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the service to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected service or access sensitive browser-based information.This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.",
