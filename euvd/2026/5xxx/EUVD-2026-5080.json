  "description": "The SupportCandy \u2013 Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.4 via the 'add_reply' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to steal file attachments uploaded by other users by specifying arbitrary attachment IDs in the 'description_attachments' parameter, re-associating those files to their own tickets and removing access from the original owners.",
