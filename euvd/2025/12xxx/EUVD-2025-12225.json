  "description": "Jmix is a set of libraries and tools to speed up Spring Boot data-centric application development. In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.",
