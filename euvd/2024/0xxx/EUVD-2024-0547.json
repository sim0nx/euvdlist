  "description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. For Cilium users who are using CRDs to store Cilium state (the default configuration) and Wireguard transparent encryption, traffic to/from the Ingress and health endpoints is not encrypted. This issue affects Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.7 and has been patched in Cilium v1.14.7. There is no workaround to this issue.",
