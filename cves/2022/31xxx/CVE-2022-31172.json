  "description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.1.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to the SignatureChecker reverting. `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` is not expected to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-1271 as expected. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `SignatureChecker` to check the validity of a signature and handle invalid signatures in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.",
