  "description": "The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018envato_code[]\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the on_ajax_register_forum_user function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
