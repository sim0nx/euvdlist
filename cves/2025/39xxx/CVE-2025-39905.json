  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phylink: add lock for serializing concurrent pl->phydev writes with resolver\n\nCurrently phylink_resolve() protects itself against concurrent\nphylink_bringup_phy() or phylink_disconnect_phy() calls which modify\npl->phydev by relying on pl->state_mutex.\n\nThe problem is that in phylink_resolve(), pl->state_mutex is in a lock\ninversion state with pl->phydev->lock. So pl->phydev->lock needs to be\nacquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing\npl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is\nracy.\n\nHence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it\nwill serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be\nmoved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.\n\nAnother alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()\nacquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()\nand phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()\nruns under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when\ncalling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been\nundesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call\npaths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was\npreferred.",
