  "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in phpipam/phpipam versions 1.5.0 through 1.6.0. The vulnerability arises when the application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe manner. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to full compromise of the user.",
