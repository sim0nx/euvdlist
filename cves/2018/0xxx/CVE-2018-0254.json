  "description": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured file action policies if an Intelligent Application Bypass (IAB) with a drop percentage threshold is also configured. The vulnerability is due to incorrect counting of the percentage of dropped traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending network traffic to a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file action policies, and traffic that should be dropped could be allowed into the network. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf86435.",
