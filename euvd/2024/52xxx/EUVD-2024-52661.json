  "description": "Ubiquiti U7-Pro 7.0.35 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability in /etc/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the observation only established that a password is present in a firmware image; however, the device cannot be deployed without setting a new password during installation.",
