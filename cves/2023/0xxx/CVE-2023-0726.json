  "description": "The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_edit_folder function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators such as changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.",
