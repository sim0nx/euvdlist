  "description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `UnravelIndex` is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow bug. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
