  "description": "A flaw was found in Quay. Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they intend to click on the top-level page. During the pentest, it has been detected that the config-editor page is vulnerable to clickjacking. This flaw allows an attacker to trick an administrator user into clicking on buttons on the config-editor panel, possibly reconfiguring some parts of the Quay instance.",
