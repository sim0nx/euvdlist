  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Now Platform that could result in data being inferred without authorization. Under certain conditional access control list (ACL) configurations, this vulnerability could enable unauthenticated and authenticated users to use range query requests to infer instance data that is not intended to be accessible to them.\n\nTo assist customers in enhancing access controls, ServiceNow has introduced additional access control frameworks in Xanadu and Yokohama, such as Query ACLs, Security Data Filters and Deny-Unless ACLs.\n\nAdditionally, in May 2025, ServiceNow delivered to customers a security update that is designed to enhance customer ACL configurations.\n\nCustomers, please review the KB Articles in the References section.",
