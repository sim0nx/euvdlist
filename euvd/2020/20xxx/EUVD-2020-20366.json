  "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of NETGEAR R7450 1.2.0.62_1.0.1 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SOAP API endpoint, which listens on TCP port 80 by default.
