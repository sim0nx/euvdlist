  "description": "The DirectoryPress Frontend plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dpfl_listingStatusChange() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update listing statuses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
