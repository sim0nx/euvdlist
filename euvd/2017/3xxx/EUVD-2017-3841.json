  "description": "A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker to enable multiple network adapters, aka a Dual-Homed Interface vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insufficient NAM policy enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating network interfaces of the device to allow multiple active network interfaces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic over a non-authorized network interface. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf66539.",
