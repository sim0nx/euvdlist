  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Corel CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 23.5.0.506. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of BMP images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16351.",
