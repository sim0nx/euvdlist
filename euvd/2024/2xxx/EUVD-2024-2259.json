  "description": "Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce Framework on Symfony. A security vulnerability was discovered in the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint, which retrieves order adjustments based on incremental integer IDs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate valid adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. Using these tokens, an attacker can access guest customer order details - sensitive guest customer information.  The issue is fixed in versions: 1.12.19, 1.13.4 and above. The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` will always return `404` status. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may alter their config to mitigate this issue. Please see the linked GHSA for details.",
