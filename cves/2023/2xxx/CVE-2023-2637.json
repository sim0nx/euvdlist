  "description": "\nRockwell Automation's FactoryTalk System Services uses a hard-coded cryptographic key to generate administrator cookies.  Hard-coded cryptographic key may lead to privilege escalation.  This vulnerability may allow a local, authenticated non-admin user to generate an invalid administrator cookie giving them administrative privileges to the FactoryTalk Policy Manger database. This may allow the threat actor to make malicious changes to the database that will be deployed when a legitimate FactoryTalk Policy Manager user deploys a security policy model. User interaction is required for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.\n\n",
