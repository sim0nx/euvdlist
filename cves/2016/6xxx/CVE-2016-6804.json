  "description": "The Apache OpenOffice installer (versions prior to 4.1.3, including some branded as OpenOffice.org) for Windows contains a defective operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This requires that the location in which the installer is run has been previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link library that the installer depends upon.",
