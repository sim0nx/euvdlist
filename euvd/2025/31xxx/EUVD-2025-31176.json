  "description": "A vulnerability was identified in JeecgBoot up to 3.8.2. Impacted is an unknown function of the file /sys/tenant/deleteBatch. The manipulation of the argument ids leads to improper authorization. The attack is possible to be carried out remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is considered difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
