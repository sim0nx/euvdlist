Boost subscribers, traffic, repeat visits,  referrals, sales and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the reset_installation() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin’s installation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
