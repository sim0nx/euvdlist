  "description": "A vulnerability in the Polaris kernel of Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to crash the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient packet size validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending jumbo frames or frames larger than the configured MTU size to the management interface of this device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the device fully before an automatic recovery.",
