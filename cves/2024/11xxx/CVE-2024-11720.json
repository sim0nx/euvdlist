  "description": "The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via submission forms in all versions up to, and including, 3.24.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the new Taxonomy form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when lower-level users have been granted access to submit specific forms, which is disabled by default.",
