  "description": "Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via \"drive-by\" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.",
