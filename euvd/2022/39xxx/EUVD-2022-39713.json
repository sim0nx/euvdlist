  "description": "FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including 1.46.16 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to an improper access restriction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by sending a URI that contains directory traversal characters to disclose the contents of files located outside of the server's restricted path. NOTE: The vendor has stated that with the introduction of firmware version 1.49.16 (Jan 2023) the FLIR AX8 should no longer be affected by the vulnerability reported. Latest firmware version (as of Oct 2025, was released Jun 2024) is 1.55.16.",
