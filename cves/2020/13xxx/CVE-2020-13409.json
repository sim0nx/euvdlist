  "description": "Tufin SecureTrack < R20-2 GA contains reflected + stored XSS (as in, the value is reflected back to the user, but is also stored within the DB and can be later triggered again by the same victim, or also later by different users). Both stored, and reflected payloads are triggerable by admin, so malicious non-authenticated user could get admin level access. Even malicious low-privileged user can inject XSS, which can be executed by admin, potentially elevating privileges and obtaining admin access. (issue 3 of 3)",
