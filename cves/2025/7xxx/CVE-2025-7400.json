  "description": "The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a post's Featured Image custom fields in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 5.2.2.",
