  "description": "Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). A critical File Upload vulnerability in versions prior to 1.5.0, with Social Engineering, allows authenticated users to deploy phishing attacks. By uploading a malicious HTML file disguised as a profile picture, an attacker can create a convincing login page replica that steals user credentials. When a victim visits the uploaded file URL, they see an authentic-looking \"Session Expired\" message prompting them to re-authenticate. All entered credentials are captured and sent to the attacker's server, enabling Account Takeover. Version 1.5.0 patches the issue.",
