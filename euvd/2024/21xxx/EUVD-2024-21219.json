  "description": "An issue was discovered on HMS Anybus X-Gateway AB7832-F 3 devices. The gateway exposes a web interface on port 80. An unauthenticated GET request to a specific URL triggers the reboot of the Anybus gateway (or at least most of its modules). An attacker can use this feature to carry out a denial of service attack by continuously sending GET requests to that URL.",
