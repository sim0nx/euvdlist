  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio: Split migration ops from main device ops\n\nvfio core checks whether the driver sets some migration op (e.g.\nset_state/get_state) and accordingly calls its op.\n\nHowever, currently mlx5 driver sets the above ops without regards to its\nmigration caps.\n\nThis might lead to unexpected usage/Oops if user space may call to the\nabove ops even if the driver doesn't support migration. As for example,\nthe migration state_mutex is not initialized in that case.\n\nThe cleanest way to manage that seems to split the migration ops from\nthe main device ops, this will let the driver setting them separately\nfrom the main ops when it's applicable.\n\nAs part of that, validate ops construction on registration and include a\ncheck for VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY since the uAPI claims it must be set\nin migration_flags.\n\nHISI driver was changed as well to match this scheme.\n\nThis scheme may enable down the road to come with some extra group of\nops (e.g. DMA log) that can be set without regards to the other options\nbased on driver caps.",
