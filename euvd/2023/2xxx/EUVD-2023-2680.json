  "description": "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana following the license change in early 2021. There is an issue with the implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch Dashboards where authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant can perform create, edit and delete operations on index metadata of dashboards and visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering them unavailable. This issue does not affect index data, only metadata. Dashboards correctly enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents. This issue does not provide additional read access to data users don\u2019t already have. This issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the cluster. Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.",
