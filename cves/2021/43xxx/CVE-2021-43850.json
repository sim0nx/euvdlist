  "description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions admins users can trigger a Denial of Service attack via the `/message-bus/_diagnostics` path. The impact of this vulnerability is greater on multisite Discourse instances (where multiple forums are served from a single application server) where any admin user on any of the forums are able to visit the `/message-bus/_diagnostics` path. The problem has been patched. Please upgrade to 2.8.0.beta10 or 2.7.12. No workarounds for this issue exist.",
