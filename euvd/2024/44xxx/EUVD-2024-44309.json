  "description": "An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects Windows servers with Web Print enabled.\u00a0This specific flaw exists within the image-handler process, which can incorrectly create files that don\u2019t exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided. This can lead to local privilege escalation.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been split into two (CVE-2024-4712 and CVE-2024-8405) and it\u2019s been rescored with a \"Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and \u201cAttack Complexity (AC)\u201d rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network users on the host server.",
