  "description": "Frappe Learning is a learning system that helps users structure their content. In versions prior to 2.38.0, the system did stored the attachments uploaded by the students in their assignments as public files. This issue potentially exposed student-uploaded files to the public. Anyone with the file URL could access these files without authentication. The issue has been fixed in version 2.38.0 by ensuring all student-uploaded assignment attachments are stored as private files by default.",
