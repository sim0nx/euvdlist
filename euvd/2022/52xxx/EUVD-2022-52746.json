  "description": "ScratchTools is a web extension designed to make interacting with the Scratch programming language community (Scratching) easier. In affected versions anybody who uses the Recently Viewed Projects feature is vulnerable to having their account taken over if they view a project that tries to. The issue is that if a user visits a project that includes Javascript in the title, then when the Recently Viewed Projects feature displays it, it could run the Javascript. This issue has been addressed in the 2.5.2 release. Users having issues scratching should open an issue in the project issue tracker https://github.com/STForScratch/ScratchTools/",
