  "description": "The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks \u2013 ComboBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized order creation in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This is due to insufficient verification on form fields. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new orders for products and mark them as paid without actually completing a payment.",
