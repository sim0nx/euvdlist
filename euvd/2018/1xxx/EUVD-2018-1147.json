  "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, high-privileged, local attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command parameters in the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking a vulnerable CLI command with crafted malicious parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with a non-root user account on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi09723.",
