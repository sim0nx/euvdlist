  "description": "Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX devices. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the configuration of the application system-on-chip (SoC). The issue results from the lack of a properly configured hardware root of trust. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the boot process. Was ZDI-CAN-26078.",
