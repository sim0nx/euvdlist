  "description": "BuddyBoss Platform through 1.8.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the email address of each user. When creating a new user, it generates a Unique ID for their profile. This UID is their private email address with symbols removed and periods replaced with hyphens. For example. JohnDoe@example.com would become /members/johndoeexample-com and Jo.test@example.com would become /members/jo-testexample-com. The members list is available to everyone and (in a default configuration) often without authentication. It is therefore trivial to collect a list of email addresses.",
