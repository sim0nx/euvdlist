  "description": "In Cloud Foundry router routing-release all versions prior to v0.163.0 and cf-release all versions prior to v274, in some applications, it is possible to append a combination of characters to the URL that will allow for an open redirect. An attacker could exploit this as a phishing attack to gain access to user credentials or other sensitive data. NOTE: 274 resolves the vulnerability but has a serious bug that is fixed in 275.",
