  "description": "The read command is used to read the keyboard input from the user, while reads it keeps the input length in a 32-bit integer value which is further used to reallocate the line buffer to accept the next character. During this process, with a line big enough it's possible to make this variable to overflow leading to a out-of-bounds write in the heap based buffer. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and secure boot bypass is not discarded as consequence.",
