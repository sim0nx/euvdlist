  "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.1002 and Application versions prior to\u00a020.0.2614\u00a0(VA and SaaS deployments) contain multiple Docker containers that include outdated, end-of-life, unsupported, or otherwise vulnerable third-party components (examples: Nginx 1.17.x, OpenSSL 1.1.1d, various EOL Alpine/Debian/Ubuntu base images, and EOL Laravel/PHP libraries). These components are present across many container images and increase the product's attack surface, enabling exploitation chains when leveraged by an attacker.\u00a0Multiple distinct EOL versions and unpatched libraries across containers; Nginx binaries date from 2019 in several images and Laravel versions observed include EOL releases (for example Laravel 5.5.x, 5.7.x, 5.8.x).\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-014 \u2014 Outdated Dependencies.",
