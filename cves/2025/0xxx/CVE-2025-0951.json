  "description": "Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress by LiquidThemes are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the liquid_reset_wordpress_before AJAX in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to deactivate all of a site's plugins. While we escalated this to Envato after not being able to establish contact, it appears the developer added a nonce check, however that is not sufficient protection as the nonce is exposed to all users with access to the dashboard.",
