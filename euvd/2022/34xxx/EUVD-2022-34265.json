  "description": "JTEKT TOYOPUC PLCs through 2022-04-29 do not ensure data integrity. They utilize the unauthenticated CMPLink/TCP protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. Control logic is downloaded to the PLC on a block-by-block basis with a given memory address and a blob of machine code. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC is not cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary machine code on the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of the PC10G-CPU, and likely for other CPU modules of the TOYOPUC family, a processor without MPU or MMU is used and this no memory protection or privilege-separation capabilities are available, giving an attacker full control over the CPU.",
