  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole 5.5.0.64. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the isHPSmartComponent method of the GWTTestServiceImpl class.
