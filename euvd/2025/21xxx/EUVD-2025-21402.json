  "description": "Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). Prior to version 0.24.3, an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution, putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains a fix for the issue.",
