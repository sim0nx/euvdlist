  "description": "The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds\n\n",
