  "description": "The ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the FAQ Builder in versions 4.8.6 through 4.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. NOTE: This vulnerability is a re-introduction of CVE-2023-4253.",
