  "description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An offline session continues to be valid when the offline_access scope is removed from the client. The refresh token is accepted and you can continue to request new tokens for the session. As it can lead to a situation where an administrator removes the scope, and assumes that offline sessions are no longer available, but they are.",
