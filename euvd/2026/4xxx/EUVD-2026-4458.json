  "description": "ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter Ping Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ALGO 8180 IP Audio Alerter devices. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the web-based user interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
