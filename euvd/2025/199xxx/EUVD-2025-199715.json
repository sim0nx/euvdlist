  "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in Hive Metastore Server (HMS) when processing delete column statistics requests via the Thrift APIs. The vulnerability is only exploitable by trusted/authorized users/applications that are allowed to call directly the Thrift APIs. In most real-world deployments, HMS is accessible to only a handful of applications (e.g., Hiveserver2) thus the vulnerability is not exploitable. Moreover, the vulnerable code cannot be reached when metastore.try.direct.sql property is set to false.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.1.0 before 4.2.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.2.0, which fixes the issue. Users who cannot upgrade directly are encouraged to set\u00a0metastore.try.direct.sql property to false if the HMS Thrift APIs are exposed to general public.",
