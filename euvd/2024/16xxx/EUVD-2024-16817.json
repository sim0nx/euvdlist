  "description": "The WP Radio \u2013 Worldwide Online Radio Stations Directory for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping as well as insufficient access control on the settings. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
