  "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an interface user. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an interface user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.",
