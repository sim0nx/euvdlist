  "description": "Products.GenericSetup is a mini-framework for expressing the configured state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts. In Products.GenericSetup before version 2.1.1 there is an information disclosure vulnerability - anonymous visitors may view log and snapshot files generated by the Generic Setup Tool. The problem has been fixed in version 2.1.1. Depending on how you have installed Products.GenericSetup, you should change the buildout version pin to 2.1.1 and re-run the buildout, or if you used pip simply do pip install `\\\"Products.GenericSetup>=2.1.1\\\"`.",
