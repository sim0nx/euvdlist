  "description": "Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Integer Overflow. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check for overflow when allocating the array for the NEWA instruction. This a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.",
