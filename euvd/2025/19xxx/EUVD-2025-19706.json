  "description": "The target device exposes a service on a specific TCP port with a configured\n endpoint. The access to that endpoint is granted using a Basic Authentication\n method. The endpoint accepts also the PUT method and it is possible to \nwrite files on the target device file system. Files are written as root.\n Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory Traversal attack \nand write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly to the PUT method, it is possible to leverage the \nsame mechanism to read any file from the file system by using the GET \nmethod.",
