  "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049\u00a0and Application prior to version 20.0.2786\u00a0(VA/SaaS deployments)\u00a0expose internal Docker containers through the gw\u00a0Docker instance.  The gateway publishes a /meta endpoint\u00a0which lists every micro\u2011service container together with version information.\u00a0These containers are reachable directly over HTTP/HTTPS\u00a0without any access\u2011control list (ACL), authentication or rate\u2011limiting.\u00a0Consequently, any attacker on the LAN or the Internet can enumerate all internal services and their versions, interact with the exposed APIs of each microservice as an unauthenticated user, or issue malicious requests that may lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation within the container, or denial\u2011of\u2011service of the entire appliance.\u00a0The root cause is the absence of authentication and network\u2011level restrictions on the API\u2011gateway\u2019s proxy to internal Docker containers, effectively turning the internal service mesh into a public attack surface.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-030 \u2014 Exposed Internal Docker Instance (LAN).",
