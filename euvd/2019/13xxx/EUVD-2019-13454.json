This flaw allows attackers to manipulate ClassLoader properties on a vulnerable server. Exploits that have been published rely on ClassLoader properties that are exposed such as those in JON 3. Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/869353. Note that while multiple products released patches for the original CVE-2014-0114 flaw, the reversion described by this CVE-2019-3834 flaw only occurred in JON 3.",
