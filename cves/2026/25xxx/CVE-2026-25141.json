  "description": "Orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification. Versions starting with 7.19.0 and prior to 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 have an incomplete fix for CVE-2026-23947. While the jsStringEscape function properly handles single quotes ('), double quotes (\") and so on, it is still possible to achieve code injection using only a limited set of characters that are currently not escaped. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application can be forced to execute arbitrary JavaScript using characters such as []()!+. By using a technique known as JSFuck, an attacker can bypass the current sanitization logic and run arbitrary code without needing any alphanumeric characters or quotes. Version 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 contain an updated fix.",
