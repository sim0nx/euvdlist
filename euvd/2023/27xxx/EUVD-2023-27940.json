  "description": "Due to missing authentication check, SAP NetWeaver AS for Java - version 7.50, allows an unauthenticated attacker to attach to an open interface and make use of an open naming and directory API to access services which can be used to perform unauthorized operations affecting users and services across systems. On a successful exploitation, the attacker can read and modify some sensitive information but can also be used to lock up any element or operation of the system making that it unresponsive or unavailable.\n\n",
