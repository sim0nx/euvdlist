  "description": "WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger MCU Command Parsing Misinterpretation of Input Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installatons of WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger devices. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of command frames received by the MCU. When parsing frames, the process does not properly detect the start of a frame, which can lead to misinterpretation of input. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26501.",
