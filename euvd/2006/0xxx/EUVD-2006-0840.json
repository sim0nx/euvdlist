  "description": "Uniden UIP1868P VoIP Telephone and Router has a default password of admin for the web-based configuration utility, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information on the device such as telephone numbers called, and possibly connect to other hosts.  NOTE: it is possible that this password was configured by a reseller, not the original vendor; if so, then this is not a vulnerability in the product.",
