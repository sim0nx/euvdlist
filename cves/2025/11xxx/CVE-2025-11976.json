  "description": "The FuseWP \u2013 WordPress User Sync to Email List & Marketing Automation (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, ActiveCampaign etc.) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_changes function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or edit sync rules via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
