  "description": "Shopware is an open source e-commerce software. In affected versions if backend admin controllers are called with a certain notation, the ACL could be bypassed. Users could execute actions, which they are normally not able to do. Users are advised to update to the current version (5.7.15). Users can get the update via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
