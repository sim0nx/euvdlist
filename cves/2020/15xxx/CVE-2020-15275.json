  "description": "MoinMoin is a wiki engine. In MoinMoin before version 1.9.11, an attacker with write permissions can upload an SVG file that contains malicious javascript. This javascript will be executed in a user's browser when the user is viewing that SVG file on the wiki. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version. MoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.",
