  "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input processing of CIP traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP traffic to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
