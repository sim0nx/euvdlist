  "description": "OpenFGA is a high-performance authorization/permission engine inspired by Google Zanzibar. Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a \u2018from\u2019 statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.",
