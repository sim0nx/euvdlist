  "description": "The Spring Security annotation detection mechanism may not correctly resolve annotations on methods within type hierarchies with a parameterized super type with unbounded generics. This can be an issue when using @PreAuthorize\u00a0and other method security annotations, resulting in an authorization bypass.\n\nYour application may be affected by this if you are using Spring Security's @EnableMethodSecurity\u00a0feature.\n\nYou are not affected by this if you are not using @EnableMethodSecurity\u00a0or if you do not use security annotations on methods in generic superclasses or generic interfaces.\n\nThis CVE is published in conjunction with  CVE-2025-41249 https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41249 .",
