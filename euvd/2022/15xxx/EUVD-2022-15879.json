  "description": "The Church Admin WordPress plugin before 3.4.135 does not have authorisation and CSRF in some of its action as well as requested files, allowing unauthenticated attackers to repeatedly request the \"refresh-backup\" action, and simultaneously keep requesting a publicly accessible temporary file generated by the plugin in order to disclose the final backup filename, which can then be fetched by the attacker to download the backup of the plugin's DB data",
