  "description": "Dot diver is a lightweight, powerful, and dependency-free TypeScript utility library that provides types and functions to work with object paths in dot notation. In versions prior to 1.0.2 there is a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `setByPath` function which can leads to remote code execution (RCE). This issue has been addressed in commit `98daf567` which has been included in release 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to this vulnerability.\n",
