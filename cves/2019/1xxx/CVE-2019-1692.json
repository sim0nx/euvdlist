  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system usage information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain components in the underlying Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to observe certain network traffic when accessing the APIC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and collect certain tracking data and usage statistics on an affected device.",
