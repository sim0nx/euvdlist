  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Network Analytics could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with valid administrative credentials to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient integrity checks within device backup files. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious backup file and restoring it to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain shell access on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.",
