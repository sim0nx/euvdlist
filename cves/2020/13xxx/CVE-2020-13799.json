  "description": "Western Digital has identified a security vulnerability in the Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol as specified in multiple standards for storage device interfaces, including all versions of eMMC, UFS, and NVMe. The RPMB protocol is specified by industry standards bodies and is implemented by storage devices from multiple vendors to assist host systems in securing trusted firmware. Several scenarios have been identified in which the RPMB state may be affected by an attacker without the knowledge of the trusted component that uses the RPMB feature.",
