  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nopen_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE\n\nAs described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series \"fs: allow\nchanging idmappings\"'), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary in order to\nallow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed\nwithout the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason,\nmount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.\n\nHowever, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 (\"fs: allow changing\nidmappings\") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling\nopen_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.\n\ncan_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached\nmountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns()\ncheck), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have\ntheir be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues\nas described in the merge commit, and was likely unintentional.",
