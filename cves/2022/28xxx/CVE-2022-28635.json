  "description": "A potential local arbitrary code execution and a local denial of service (DoS) vulnerability within an isolated process were discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) firmware version(s): Prior to 2.71. An unprivileged user could locally exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability within that process. In addition, an unprivileged user could exploit a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of availability within that process. A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attackers control. HPE has provided a firmware update to resolve this vulnerability in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5).",
