  "description": "immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. In versions prior to 1.4.1, a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value. This vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1.",
