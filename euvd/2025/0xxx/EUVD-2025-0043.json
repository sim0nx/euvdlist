  "description": "go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability.",
