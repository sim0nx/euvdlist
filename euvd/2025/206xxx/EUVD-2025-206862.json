  "description": "Monstra CMS v3.0.4 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Files Manager plugin. The application relies on blacklist-based file extension validation and stores uploaded files directly in a web-accessible directory. Under typical server configurations, this can allow an attacker to upload files that are interpreted as executable code, resulting in remote code execution.",
