  "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in search.asp in Tendenci CMS allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) category, (2) searchtext, (3) jobcategoryid, (4) contactcompany, and unspecified other parameters.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
