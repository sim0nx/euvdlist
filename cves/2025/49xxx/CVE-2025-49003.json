  "description": "DataEase is an open source business intelligence and data visualization tool. Prior to version 2.10.11, a threat actor may take advantage of a feature in Java in which the character \"ı\" becomes \"I\" when converted to uppercase, and the character \"ſ\" becomes \"S\" when converted to uppercase. A threat actor who uses a carefully crafted message that exploits this character conversion can cause remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.11. No known workarounds are available.",
