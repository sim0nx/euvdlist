  "description": "The Analytics Reduce Bounce Rate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the unbounce_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify Google Analytics tracking settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
