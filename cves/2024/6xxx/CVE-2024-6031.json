  "description": "Tesla Model S oFono AT Command Heap-based Buffer Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model S vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n \nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of responses from AT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23198.",
