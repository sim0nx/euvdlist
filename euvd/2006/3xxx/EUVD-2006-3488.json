  "description": "Buffer overflow in LsCreateLine function (mso_203) in mso.dll and mso9.dll, as used by Microsoft Word and possibly other products in Microsoft Office 2003, 2002, and 2000, allows remote user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Word DOC or other Office file type.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported to allow code execution, but on 20060710 Microsoft stated that code execution is not possible, and the original researcher agrees.",
