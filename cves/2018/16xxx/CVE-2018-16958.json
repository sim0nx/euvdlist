  "description": "An issue was discovered in Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal 10.3.3. The ASP.NET_SessionID primary session cookie, when Internet Information Services (IIS) with ASP.NET is used, is not protected with the HttpOnly attribute. The attribute cannot be enabled by customers. Consequently, this cookie is exposed to session hijacking attacks should an adversary be able to execute JavaScript in the origin of the portal installation. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.",
