  "description": "An issue was discovered in mcp-neo4j 0.3.0 allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands via the SSE service. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that authentication is not mandatory for MCP servers, and the mcp-neo4j MCP server is only intended for use in a local environment where authentication realistically would not be needed. Also, the Supplier provides middleware to help isolate the MCP server from external access (if needed).",
