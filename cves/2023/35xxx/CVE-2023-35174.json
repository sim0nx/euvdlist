  "description": "Livebook is a web application for writing interactive and collaborative code notebooks. On Windows, it is possible to open a `livebook://` link from a browser which opens Livebook Desktop and triggers arbitrary code execution on victim's machine. Any user using Livebook Desktop on Windows is potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when they expect Livebook to be opened from browser. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.8.2 and 0.9.3.\n\n",
