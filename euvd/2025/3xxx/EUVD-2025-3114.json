  "description": "On most desktop platforms, Brave Browser versions 1.70.x-1.73.x included a feature to show a site's origin on the OS-provided file selector dialog when a site prompts the user to upload or download a file. However the origin was not correctly inferred in some cases. When combined with an open redirector vulnerability on a trusted site, this could allow a malicious site to initiate a download whose origin in the file select dialog appears as the trusted site which initiated the redirect.",
