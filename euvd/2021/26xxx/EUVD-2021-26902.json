  "description": "An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.",
