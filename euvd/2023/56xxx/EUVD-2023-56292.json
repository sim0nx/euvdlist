  "description": "BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP avrcp_parse_attribute_list Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20852.",
