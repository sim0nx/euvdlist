  "description": "It was discovered that the sls-logging was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service. In the case of AtlasDB, the vulnerability was mitigated by other network controls such as two-way TLS when deployed as part of a Palantir platform. Palantir still recommends upgrading to a non-vulnerable version out of an abundance of caution.",
