  "description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as relay.sh which allows the device to create relay ports and connect the device to Vera servers. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera servers so the devices can be communicated with even when the user is not at home. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is \"remote_host\". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to \"eval\" to execute another script where remote_host is concatenated to be passed a parameter to the second script. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.",
