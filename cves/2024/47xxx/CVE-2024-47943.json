  "description": "The firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface of the RittalÂ IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit devices checks if \nthe patch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh \nscript. The signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key\n which is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for \ndownload. This allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order \nto compromise the device and execute arbitrary code.",
