  "description": "Insufficient RegEx in private-ip npm package v1.0.5 and below insufficiently filters reserved IP ranges resulting in indeterminate SSRF. An attacker can perform a large range of requests to ARIN reserved IP ranges, resulting in an indeterminable number of critical attack vectors, allowing remote attackers to request server-side resources or potentially execute arbitrary code through various SSRF techniques.",
