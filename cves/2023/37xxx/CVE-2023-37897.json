  "description": "Grav is a file-based Web-platform built in PHP. Grav is subject to a server side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability. The fix for another SSTI vulnerability using `|map`, `|filter` and `|reduce` twigs implemented in the commit `71bbed1` introduces bypass of the denylist due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which allows to execute the payload prepending double backslash (`\\\\`). The `isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and onwards retuns `false` value instead of `true` when the `\\` symbol is found in the `$name`. This vulnerability can be exploited if the attacker has access to: 1. an Administrator account, or 2. a non-administrator, user account that has Admin panel access and Create/Update page permissions. A fix for this vulnerability has been introduced in commit `b4c6210` and is included in release version `1.7.42.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n",
