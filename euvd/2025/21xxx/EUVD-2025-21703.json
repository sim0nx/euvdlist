  "description": "Broken access control in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT prior to 7.8.1 allows an attacker to create a denial of service situation when configured to use GoAnywhere One-Time Password (GOTP) email two-factor authentication (2FA) and the user has not set an email address. In this scenario, the attacker may enter the email address of a known user when prompted and the user will be disabled if that user has configured GOTP.",
