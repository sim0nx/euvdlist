  "description": "spimsimulator spim v9.1.24 and before is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the READ_SYSCALL and WRITE_SYSCALL system calls. The application verifies the legitimacy of the starting and ending addresses for memory read/write operations. By configuring the starting and ending addresses for memory read/write to point to distinct memory segments within the virtual machine, it is possible to circumvent these checks.",
