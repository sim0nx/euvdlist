  "description": "The WP Abstracts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
